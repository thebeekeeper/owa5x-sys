owa5x-sys
---------

Bindgen crate for the new owa5x hardware.


To build, make sure to download the compiler libraries from the Owasys developer site, and unzip it to `/opt/owa-lib/`.  There appears to be some references to `owa4x` in the initial release which can be changed to the correct `owa5x` directory.

Also need to `apt install gcc-multilib` to get the right headers etc.
